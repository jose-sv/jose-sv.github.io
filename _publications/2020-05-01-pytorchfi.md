PyTorchFI is a runtime perturbation tool for deep neural networks (DNNs), implemented for the popular PyTorch 
deep learning platform. PyTorchFI enables users to perform perturbations 
on weights or neurons of DNNs at runtime. 
It is designed with the programmer in mind, providing a simple 
and easy-to-use API, requiring as little as three lines of code for use. It also 
provides an extensible interface, enabling researchers to 
choose from various perturbation models (or design their 
own custom models), which allows for the study of hardware error 
(or general perturbation) propagation to the software layer of the DNN output.
Additionally, PyTorchFI is extremely versatile: we demonstrate how it can
be applied to five different use cases for dependability and reliability research, 
including resiliency analysis of classification
networks, resiliency analysis of object detection networks, analysis of models
robust to adversarial attacks, training resilient models, and for DNN interpertability.
This paper discusses the technical underpinnings and 
design decisions of PyTorchFI which make it an easy-to-use, extensible, fast,
and versatile research tool. PyTorchFI is open-sourced and available 
for download via pip or github at: [https://github.com/pytorchfi](https://github.com/pytorchfi)
