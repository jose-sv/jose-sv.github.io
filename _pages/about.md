Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
working under [Chris Fletcher](http://cwfletcher.net/).
My work lives in the intersection of Adversarial Machine Learning and
Hardware Security.
 
I received my B.S. from Lawrence Technological University (in Southfield, MI),
where I was a dual recipient of a Presidential Research Grant.
I went on to complete my M.S. at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
in the fall of 2019.
My M.S. culminated in the introduction of
[Asynchronous Poisoning Attacks](https://jose-sv.github.io/publication/2020-03-01-game-of-threads).
I've stayed as a Ph.D. student at UIUC, where I live with my wife and our
 three cats.
